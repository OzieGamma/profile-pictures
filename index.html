            Profile pictures are an essential element of any social app. They are usually square or round. Together with user names they enable users to properly identify each other. Names alone can be ambiguous and profile pictures remove this ambiguity.

            More and more users are bots or other non-humans (such as groups of people or companies). I believe users should be able to differentiate between speaking to a bot and another human. To convey this information, I suggest using profile picture shapes.

        <h3>Human</h3>
        <img src="pp.jpg" classname="human"></img>
        
        <h3>Organization</h3>
        <img src="pp.jpg" classname="organization"></img>
        
        <h3>Bot</h3>
        <div classname="bot-outer">
            <img src="robot.png" classname="bot-inner"></img>
